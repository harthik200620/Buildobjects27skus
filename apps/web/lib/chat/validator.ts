/**
 * The grounding validator. Fails closed.
 *
 * ── WHERE THIS CAME FROM ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Ported from the BuildO price-intelligence assistant, where it was written and
 * calibrated against a live catalogue. The MECHANISM is unchanged, because the
 * mechanism is not domain-specific: a model cannot be trusted to report whether
 * it made something up, so it is never asked, and everything it says is held
 * against a ledger of what the tools actually returned.
 *
 * What changed here is only the vocabulary and the refusal — this store sells
 * tiles, bulbs, solar, CCTV, extinguishers, glass, epoxy and total stations as
 * well as cement and steel, and it answers to one refusal sentence rather than
 * three.
 *
 * The premise: a model cannot be trusted to report whether it made something
 * up, so it is never asked. Every number and every named entity in the draft
 * is extracted mechanically and held against the FactLedger the tools
 * deposited during this turn. Anything not in the ledger is a violation, and a
 * draft with violations does not reach the user.
 *
 * The engine gets one silent repair attempt — the draft goes back to the model
 * with its own violations listed — and if that fails too, the turn degrades to
 * an honest "I don't have that" instead of a plausible fiction. Degrading to
 * silence is the entire point. A price assistant that is occasionally wrong is
 * worth less than one that is occasionally unhelpful, because a wrong landed
 * price becomes a signed purchase order.
 *
 * Calibration is the hard part, and the failure mode to avoid is a validator
 * that fires on true statements: one false positive on a correct answer and
 * the operator turns the whole thing off. So three categories are exempt, and
 * each one is a deliberate hole with a reason:
 *
 *   - Numbers the USER supplied. Echoing "your 50 bags" is not invention.
 *   - Structural numerals: list markers, "step 2 of 3", ordinals in prose.
 *   - A closed vocabulary of domain terms that name nothing — GST, ISI, OPC,
 *     CPVC, "Hyderabad". These are words, not claims.
