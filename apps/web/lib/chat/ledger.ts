/**
 * The fact ledger. Every tool call deposits the atoms it will stand behind — the numbers it read
 * or computed, the entity names it saw, the sources they came from — and the validator holds the
 * model's draft against it.
 *
 * The inversion matters: the usual approach asks a model to cite its sources and trusts it to have
 * done so. This asks nothing of the model and verifies mechanically. A model that invents "Rs 412
 * per bag" fails because 412 is not in the ledger, not because it forgot a citation.
 *
 * Numbers are stored at several roundings on purpose. The tool holds `normalised_paise = 32160`;
 * the reply will say "Rs 321.60" or "Rs 322" or "Rs 321", all the same fact. A validator that knew
 * only 32160 would reject the correct answer — and one that fires on true statements gets switched
 * off.
 */

 * A run of capitalised words — a brand, a vendor, a standard, a place.

 * Defined here rather than in the validator so that the side that DEPOSITS
 * names and the side that CHECKS them cannot drift apart. `validator.ts`
 * imports it; the dependency runs that way round because the validator already
 * imports FactLedger, and the reverse would be a cycle.
 *
 * Returned as a factory because /g regexes carry lastIndex between calls.
